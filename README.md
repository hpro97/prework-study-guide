# prework-study-guide

## Description

The purpose of this guide is to hold usefull notes learned during the pre-boot camp and display them in a relatively orderly and intuitive fashion. I built this project for future reference and as a first step for my personal coding portfolio. By creating this project i overcame coding challenges and got into the habit of doing daily lessons on coding, with a finished product that i can use as reference when facing future challenges. from this project i learn basic front end web development skills to later build upon in future projects.
